# Environment_Segmentation

## Overview
This project involves implementing, training, and evaluating three models: **U-Net**, **DeepLabv3+**, and **YOLO** on the Cityscape dataset. The aim is to compare these models in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and F1 score.
